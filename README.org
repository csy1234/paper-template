** Assumptions

- The paper is in =paper=.
- Code goes into =code=.
- Data goes into =data=.
- Cryptobib is in a directory pointed to by ~BIBINPUTS=.:/path-to/cryptobib~
- Scripts write to ~paper/constants.tex~ for use with [[https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfkeys?lang=en][pgfkeys]].

** Local Changes 

If you want to do local modification to ~.dir-locals.el~ which is under version control, you can use

#+begin_src sh
git update-index --assume-unchanged .dir-locals.el
#+end_src

to tell git to ignore changes to that file. Use

#+begin_src sh
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged .dir-locals.el
#+end_src

to undo.
